# summoner-app

Trying out Riot's REST Api's by implementing an app that displays data about a specific summoner or a group of summoners.

The following files should be in the same folder:

    -summoner_app.py
    
    -summoner_data.py
    
    -riot.py
    
    -overview_widget.py
    
    -rune_widget.py
    
    -mastery_widget.py
    
    -champions_widget.py
    
    -images

To run the app use the following command:

    python summoner_app.py

Currently it displays rune and mastery pages as well as general info about the player. (still working on it ...)
